This has 3 EEPROM chips, two are hard to access. A Slight modification to the "Test-Clip" with a razor makes it possible to reach 24C64WP! You have to trim back the plastic on each side to let it recess deeper between the SAS ports.

- 24C03WI - easiest to access, closes to edge & in middle
- 24C08K - next to DIM slot, Test-Clip barely fits!
- 24C64WP - between SAS ports, hard to access
